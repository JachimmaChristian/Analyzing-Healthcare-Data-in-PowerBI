# Analyzing-Healthcare-Data-in-PowerBI
In healthcare, improving efficiency while maintaining high-quality patient care is a top priority. In this PowerBI Case study, I explored a real-world dataset to uncover hospital efficiency insights, I analyzed attributes impacting the patient's length of stay (LOS) and cost and worked to identify factors contributing to hospital differences. 

I leveraged my DAX skills to create measures and generate insightful visualizations. To finish off, I brought it all together in a sophisticated business dashboard to communicate insights to the team. 

This case study gave me a chance to practice a range of Power BI skills, working with real-world data.  

Enough with the chitchat let's dive in!

# The Problem
In this case study, a fictitious consulting company called HealthStat has hired me to uncover insights on potential hospital efficiency opportunities, and they would like me to analyze a state-wide hospital dataset and leverage my Power BI skills to create an engaging dashboard of insights.

# Case Study Details
In healthcare analytics there are several quality metrics to be considered but for this case study, I'll focus on efficiency, which is all about avoiding waste. This includes minimizing waste of equipment, supplies, ideas and energy.

Length of stay (or LOS) is considered an important indicator of the efficiency of hospital management. It's calculated as the total duration in days for a patient stay in a hospital. A shorter LOS is often desirable in hospital operations. Although, many factors can impact LOS. Patient age, health status, the type of procedure (or surgery), whether or not there were any complications, and the size of the hospital are some common factors.

Here are some terms you will encounter throughout this case study: 

An inpatient: is a person who has been admitted to a hospital bed. 

A discharge: is defined as the release of a patient from hospital care by a medical worker. 

Disposition: This is the patient destination or status upon discharge, for instance to another facility or to home. 

An elective surgery: is a procedure that was planned in advance, in other words, it was not due to an emergency.
