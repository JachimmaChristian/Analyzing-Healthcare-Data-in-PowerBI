# Analyzing-Healthcare-Data-in-PowerBI
In healthcare, improving efficiency while maintaining high-quality patient care is a top priority. In this PowerBI Case study, I explored a real-world dataset to uncover hospital efficiency insights for a fictional consulting company called HealthStat. 

I analyzed attributes impacting the patient length of stay (LOS) and cost and work to identify factors contributing to hospital differences. I leveraged my DAX skills to create measures and generate insightful visualizations. To finish off, I brought it all together in a sophisticated business dashboard to communicate insights for the HealthStat team. 

This case study gav me a chance to practice a range of Power BI skills, working with real-world data.  

Enough with the chitchat lets dive in!
